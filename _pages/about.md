Hello! I'm Shahriar Hasan Emon, an undergraduate student studying Linguistics at [University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/). My academic curiosity leans towards Phonetics (which means I make weird noises that freak people out), Phonology, Syntax and South Asian languages, especially Bengali. 



I am equally drawn to Mathematics, my first love, and Computer Science. I wish to explore the intersection of these fields through Formal Language Theory, NLP and Computational Linguistics.  


When I'm not buried in vowel shifts, I am probably listening to too much music or watching movies, talking politics or history. If you follow me on socials, you may hear me singing or ranting about random stuff - unfortunately for you. I wish to learn musical instruments someday, perhaps the keyboard or tabla. I want to start writing about a lot of things but I'm too lazy. I'm currently working on some stupid (but interesting to me) projects as I learn and explore, but the serious stuff are coming up.
